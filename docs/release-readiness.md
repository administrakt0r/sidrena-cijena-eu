# Release 1.0.0 verification

Release preparation started 25 September 2026. The plugin header, runtime
constant, npm manifest/lock and WordPress stable tag agree on 1.0.0.

The translation generator reads the plugin header. Both source catalogs contain
427 translated strings and zero untranslated strings. The Croatian MO compiler
now calculates offsets for its separate original/translation string blocks;
every dictionary entry was round-tripped through WordPress's MO reader.
The runtime catalog uses `sidrena-cijena-hr.mo`: WordPress's Croatian locale
identifier is `hr`, although the development dictionary is named `hr_HR.php`.

Verification so far:

- Unit: 119 tests, 380 assertions.
- Integration: 70 tests, 329 assertions after `sg docker -c 'npx wp-env clean tests'`.
  Existing E2E location/publication rows had contaminated the initial run.
- PHPStan, PHPCS and ESLint: clean.
- `sg docker -c './local.sh'`: exit 0.
- E2E: 27 passed (4.1 minutes), exclusively on port 8889.
- Clean ZIP installation: passed on fresh WordPress 7.1.2 / PHP 8.3 without
  WooCommerce. A disposable wp-env on ports 8890/8891 was destroyed and recreated.
  The final ZIP (source commit `7e98210`) installed and activated on its pristine
  test instance. Verification checked runtime version, every schema table,
  Croatian translation through `switch_to_locale('hr')` and `__()`, and absence
  of development dependencies. `unzip -t` also passed.

The integration bootstrap no longer predefines constants owned by the plugin,
eliminating duplicate-constant warnings during actual WordPress loading.

Build from a clean checkout of the release commit with
`tools/build-zip.sh 1.0.0`. An isolated checkout allows the developer's unrelated
working-tree changes to remain untouched. The archive contains runtime sources,
assets, templates, catalogs and documentation; development dependencies are excluded.
